The SIM800C GSM/GPRS module is a compact GSM modem ideal for a variety of IoT projects. This versatile module enables you to perform functions similar to a regular cell phone, including sending SMS messages, making phone calls, connecting to the Internet via GPRS, and more. Additionally, it features Bluetooth connectivity for added versatility.

Unlike many existing GSM modules, our SIM800C addresses common issues, such as module burning or unresponsiveness to "AT Commands" when voltage fluctuates. Our module stands out by supporting a wide voltage range, from 5V to 20V. For those planning to take their projects into production, it effortlessly runs on a 12V 1A Power Supply.

Moreover, the active light wire of the GSM module can be easily extracted and utilized, adding a captivating element to your project or product.

Explore the possibilities with the SIM800C—your gateway to reliable and flexible communication in your IoT endeavors.
