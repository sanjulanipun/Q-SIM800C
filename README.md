The SIM800C GSM/GPRS module is a miniature GSM modem that can be used in a variety of IoT projects. You can use this module to do almost anything a normal cell phone can do, such as sending SMS messages, making phone calls, connecting to the Internet via GPRS, and much more. And because this module has Bluetooth, you can use that facility as well.

There are many problems with the current GSM modules in the market. Especially when the voltage increases or decreases, many problems can be seen such as the module burning or not responding to the "AT Commands" and not being active for a long time.

So our module is unique in that it can provide a wide range of voltage from 5V to 20V. If you are planning to take the project to production, you can easily run this with a 12V 1A Power Supply.

Also, the active light wire of the gsm module can be taken out and used, so it can add more attraction to your project/product.
